    <p>In relation to the pdf you can download, here are some descriptions of Riley’s works through the years, from painting, to tattooing, illustrations and finally a few graphic design concept projects.</p>

    <h2>Paintings</h2>

    <p>Photos 1 through 3 are a series of flower paintings Riley created over a 6 month period.  By using bright colours and painting what she knows best, Riley was able to use art to work through tough situations and grow her style.</p>

    <h2>Tattoos</h2>

    <p>Photos 4 through 6 are tattoo projects that Riley felt best portrayed her work as a tattoo artist.  She loved using linework, dotwork and small fill work with organic shapes to produce fun and interesting tattoos.</p>

    <h2>Illustrations</h2>
 
    <p>Photo 7 was a project Riley created for an art submission for a zine on Sonastalgia, or “eco-anxiety.”  Her work was chosen among a few other artists to be featured in the zine.</p>

    <p>Photos 8 through 10 are illustrations Riley created on her own time using procreate.  Number 9 is part of a 5 part series of illustrations she sold as prints at two art markets.</p>

    <h2>Graphic Design</h2>

    <p>Finally, photos 11 through 13 are works Riley created for school projects.  Number 11 is a street banner concept for Granville Island created on procreate, number 12 is a magazine concept created on photoshop and number 13 is a poster created on illustrator, representing the cherry blossom festivals in Japan.</p>
