<h2>All things Art </h2>

    <p>Ever since she was a child, Riley has been in love with all things art.</p>  
    <p>She started with drawing and painting, getting tips and tricks from her grandma who has her paintings shared around the world, and her aunt who sells commission paintings.</p>
    <p>She dabbled in abstract paintings and later moved more into nature paintings, specifically flowers.</p>  
    <p>Sheâ€™s also experimented in print and sticker making, creating prints and stickers on procreate and selling them through her instagram and at art markets.  
    <p>She loves to combine different mediums, creating paintings using acrylic paint as well as expired tattoo ink and paint pens and she loves to learn new ways of expressing her artistic side whether it be through jewelry making, drawing and painting, graphic design or illustrations.</p>

<h2>Art and Mental Health</h2>
    <p>As Riley navigated through mental health struggles, she realized that art can be a powerful tool for enhancing mental health in several meaningful ways.</p>
    
    <h3>Self Expression</h3>
    <p>Creating art allows individuals to express feelings and thoughts that might be difficult to articulate verbally. This can provide an emotional release, helping to process complex emotions and experiences.</p>
    <h3>Mindfulness and Focus</h3>
    <p>Engaging in artistic activities often encourages mindfulness. Focusing on the process of creating can ground individuals in the present moment, reducing anxiety and stress.</p>
    <h3>Therapeutic Benefits</h3>
    <p>Art therapy, facilitated by trained professionals, leverages creative processes to address psychological issues. It can be particularly effective for those dealing with trauma, depression, or anxiety, allowing them to explore feelings in a safe environment.</p>
    <h3>Building confidence</h3>
    <p>Completing a piece of art can foster a sense of achievement and boost self-esteem. This is especially important for individuals who may struggle with self-worth, as it reinforces the idea that their creativity has value.</p>
    <h3>Social Connection</h3>
    <p>Participating in group art activities or classes can cultivate a sense of community. Sharing creative experiences can lead to meaningful connections with others, reducing feelings of isolation.</p>
    <h3>Cognitive Benefits</h3>
    <p>Engaging in art stimulates the brain and can enhance problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. This cognitive engagement can be therapeutic in itself, providing a constructive distraction from negative thoughts.</p>
    <h3>Emotional Resilience</h3>
    <p>Creating and appreciating art can help individuals build resilience. It encourages exploration of different perspectives and coping strategies, which can be beneficial when facing challenges in life.</p>
    <h3>Physical Benefits</h3>
    <p>Art-making can also have physical benefits. The act of creating can reduce stress hormones, lower blood pressure, and even improve motor skills, contributing to overall well-being.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In summary, art serves as a multifaceted resource for mental health. Whether through personal expression, therapeutic practices, or community engagement, the act of creating and appreciating art can foster healing, connection, and resilience. Embracing art in its many forms can be a valuable part of a holistic approach to mental wellness.</p>

    <p>Riley got a taste of the graphic design world when she first started tattooing.  By creating posts for her website and instagram to build her clientele she learnt a bit about composition and colour theory.  She was also given the opportunity to create a logo for a clients new essential oil business which really peaked her interest in graphic design.</p>

    <p>After a couple years in the tattoo industry she decided to go for a change in career, feeling pulled towards the graphic design world.  She wanted to learn more about visual language, typography, web design, how to clearly and creatively portray ideas and concepts and how to use the adobe programs.  She is currently in the Graphic Design program at BCIT hoping to expand her knowledge and learn all about what it takes to become a graphic designer.</p>
