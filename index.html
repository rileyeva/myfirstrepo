<h2>All things art!</h2>

    <p>Riley is a creative and passionate artist who has been painting, sketching and drawing her whole life.  She is seeking to contribute her unique artistic vision and technical skills to graphic design while continuing to grow and develop in multiple mediums as an artist.</p>

    <p>Specializing in nature inspired works, Riley loves to play with bright colours and organic shapes, creating works with depth and movement.  She has dabbled in many different forms of art, including resin jewelry, beading, crochet, sewing, fabric painting and music.</p>

<h2>The world of tattooing</h2>

<p>Riley has experience as a tattoo artist, she believes her experience in this field helped her to understand graphic design a bit better and developed her eye for colour and composition.</p>
